= countdown

Decrease a counter from an  `initial` value.
Child commands will be invoked each time after the counter reaches 0. A `name` can be used to share the counter across other scripts make it accesible to `js` via `QD.counters`.

[source,yaml]
----
- countdown: 5 #private counter
- countdown: myvar 5 #accessible by name
----

NOTE: using a named counter requires all instances use the same initial value. qDup will raise an error if the values are different.
